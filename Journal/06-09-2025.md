# Day 1 - 06/09/2025

Today marks the beginning of my Neetcode 150 Journey. I plan to go in order from top to bottom for each category, starting from Arrays & Hashing.
I have solved some of these problems previously, so a couple weren't new, but I don't think they had optimal time and space complexity.
I just decided to start from the beginning, and see if I can make it optimal. I plan to revisit them in the end to see if I can code it optimally.
Most of these problems were fairly easy, with a little difficulty on Group Anagrams.
Overall, felt good about tackling these problems. I hope tomorrow will be the same.
Although I struggled on Encode and Decode strings, so tomorrow might be a bit tough.

## What I solved today
- Contains Duplicate
- Valid Anagram
- Two Sum
- Group Anagrams
- Top K Frequent Elements

## What I worked on today (WIP)
- Encode and Decode Strings

## Challenges / What I learned
- Using hashmaps, tuples, and 0 arrays for better complexities. Better compared to previous attempts.

## Next steps / To improve
- Need to solve the WIP problems tomorrow
- Not sure how to go about it, but will look at hints to see how to approach the problem
