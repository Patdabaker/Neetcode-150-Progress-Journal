# Day 13 - 6/21/2025

This is day 13 of my Neetcode 150 journey. I started off the day by solving the problem, Car
Fleet. This was honestly a weird problem for me, as  I was confused most of the time. I could
not get the logic down by myself, and needed to read the hints in order to get started. Otherwise,
I would've given up. Though because I did read it, I solved it, and optimally too. While I did,
I'm honestly not that proud, and feel kind of bad for reading the hints in the first place because
it felt like I was given the answer just by reading them. So even though I solved it perfectly,
I'm not proud of what I've done. I should be able to do it alone without any hints.

I then moved on to the hard level problem, Largest Rectangle In Histogram. I was thinking it
through, and couldn't get the logic behind it. My time limit ran out for the day, not the problem,
so it's going to be something I work on for a bit tomorrow. Hopefully I'll be able to do it, but
I'll most likely rely on hints again. I guess it's fine, but I would really rather not. 

Overall it was an okay day. Not a day I'm proud of, but it's ok.
