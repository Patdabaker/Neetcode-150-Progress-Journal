# Day 9 - 6/17/2025

This is day 9 of my Neetcode 150 journey. I'm honestly not feeling it today, and I really don't
want to do this, but I'll force myself to. I'll continue on to problem 22, Minimum Stack. This
problem is easy to brute force, kinda difficult to get the correct time complexity. I eventually
ran out of time and brute forced it all. I looked at the optimal solution, and I was on the
right track, so not too bad. I'll try to remember for next time.

Then I moved on to the last problem, which was a little weird. I didn't know what reverse
Polish notation was, so I was a little lost. I also didn't have too much time, so I quickly
did what I thought would work for what I thought was RPN, and it didn't work of course. I'm not
too worried, because I need to learn RPN first before I tackle the problem. So I plan on doing
that tomorrow and hopefully solving it correctly.

Overall not a good day because I was tired, lazy, and had a bad mental state, so I didn't really
care too much. Hopefully tomorrow is better once I get more rest.

## What I solved today
- Minimum Stack

## What I worked on today (WIP)
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

## Challenges / What I learned
- Challenging to create a stack class all with O(1) time complexity for all functions

## Next steps / To improve
- Try to understand solution for problem 22 and do it next time
- Learn RPN in order to solve problem 23
