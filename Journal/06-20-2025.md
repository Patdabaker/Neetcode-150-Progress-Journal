# Day 12 - 6/20/2025

Just like day 11, I'm writing this late because I skipped the day. I was extremely tired from day
11, so I decided to take another day off. I think it was a good thing because I feel like I 
desperately needed the rest. Though I hope to continue my journey as I did previously.
