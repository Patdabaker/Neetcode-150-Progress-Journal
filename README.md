# Neetcode-150-Progress-Journal
This will be a daily journal on my progress through the Neetcode 150.

I will update this repository everyday, no matter my progress on the 150. If there are days where I make no progress, I will still update to show that I have no progress. As taken advice from reddit, I plan to have some rules for myself throughtout this journey.
Rule #1: Have Fun :)
Rule #2: Spend max an hour on each problem, and look up solutions if I'm not close to a solution. 
Rule #3: Do at least 2 problems a day. So with rule 2, this will be 2 hours a day on neetcode. Could potentially solve more if time spent is less than an hour on each problem.
These are the 3 rules I have so far, and may update them in the future if need be.
